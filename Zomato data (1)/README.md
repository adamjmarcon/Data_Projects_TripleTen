In this project we are determining the key metrics for assessing which brands should be future affiliates of Zomato.

Questions:
-	What key factors determine the fiscal and critical success of our affiliated restaurants? (profit/review rating)
-	Are these key factors transferable from high-performing affiliates to struggling ones? If so, how do we implement these changes? If not, how should struggling affiliates be handled?

Hypothesis:
-	There are likely select commonalities between our high-performing affiliates and our struggling ones. By examining the location, menu options, customer reviews and revenue we will determine which characteristics predict high performance and use this as a template to 1) determine our current best performers. 2) levy accurate and constructive feedback to struggling restaurants. 3) more efficiently vet potential affiliates in the future based on the results of this analysis.  

Visualization: 
-	This analysis will require several visual components to properly demonstrate its findings step-by-step. The final dashboard will be presented in a series of slides accompanied by narration for a presentation lasting 15 to 20 minutes. 
-	We will present visuals that show our reach, the primary regions we operate in. We will then separate these into high-performing to low-performing across multiple metrics (mainly revenue/profit, Customer Review). For the purposes of this analysis we will filter out locations that do not have a substantial number of Customer Reviews as these are unlikely to represent the data accurately. We will cross-examine any findings of reviews and revenue against the location, menu options, and pricing of the locations.
Additional Notes:
 

Deductions:
-	Exposure (# of locations) for top brands results in much higher revenue. Brands like McDonald's, Dominoes, Pizza Hut prove this rule.
-	Large cities are split into provinces and each of these cities once properly summed are the most profitable. The larger the city, the higher the profit so long as Zomato has necessary representation. Bangalore and Dehli prove this rule. 
- Cuisine is the most important factor. Sticking to Indian and Chinese cuisine yielded consistently positive results.
-	Reviews as currently constructed are wildly uneven. Little can be gleaned from them beyond a vague sense of popularity/performance.


Solutions:
-	Stick to major cities. Establish a presence in Mumbai. It's one of the three largest cities in India, yet Zomato is not as prominent there as they are in Dehli and Bangalore.
-	Work with large chains whenever possible. Exposure guarantees a customer base. The more locations with a recognizable brand, the better.
-	If working with a smaller brand, stick to one of the top-performing cuisines (Indian/Chinese/Fast Food/Bakery/Beverage)
-	Maximize profit by encouraging major brands to offer alternative cuisine options such as the five listed above.

BONUS:
-	Much of this data is hidden behind error, be thorough. Large cities are split into burroughs and need to be summed, the same can be said of larger resturaunt brands.
-	Ratings have limited use but can be improved. Encourage customers to leave honest reviews on affiliated brands to vet performance. (Aim should be for a 3.8 or above)
