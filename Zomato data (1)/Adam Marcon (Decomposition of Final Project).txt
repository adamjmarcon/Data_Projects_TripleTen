Final Project Loom: https://www.loom.com/share/b7848bac8e7146ab82f23846f8691466?sid=a1f886be-56a1-4ffa-bdd6-88e1bb153163


Additional notes are located below the initial Decomp!


Questions:
-	What key factors determine the fiscal and critical success of our affiliated restaurants? (profit/review rating)
-	Are these key factors transferable from high-performing affiliates to struggling ones? If so, how do we implement these changes? If not, how should struggling affiliates be handled?
Hypothesis:
-	There are likely select commonalities between our high-performing affiliates and our struggling ones. By examining the location, menu options, and pricing of our affiliated restaurants and comparing them with their customer reviews and revenue we will determine which characteristics generally perform well and use this as a template to 1) determine our current best performers. 2) levy accurate and constructive feedback to struggling restaurants. 3) more efficiently vet potential affiliates in the future based on the results of this analysis.  
Visualization: 
-	This analysis will require several visual components to properly demonstrate its findings step-by-step. The final dashboard will be presented in a series of slides accompanied by narration for a presentation lasting 5 to 10 minutes. 
-	We will present visuals that show our reach, the primary regions we operate in. We will then separate these into high-performing to low-performing across multiple metrics (mainly revenue/profit, Customer Review). For the purposes of this analysis we will filter out locations that do not have a substantial number of Customer Reviews as these are unlikely to represent the data accurately. We will cross-examine any findings of reviews and revenue against the location, menu options, and pricing of the locations.
Additional Notes:
-	In my brief time examining the general data I noticed a significant amount of revenue under the NULL section. I would simply like it to be known that I am filtering this out of the study. I’m not sure if this is the result of bookkeeping, locations we are no longer affiliated with, or something else. However, if it is not linked to any of our affiliated locations then it is not useful for this analysis and thus will be removed. 
-	If there are any other questions/concerns/requirements needed from this write-up before I begin assembling the dashboard, please let me know and I will deliver it ASAP.

Thank you!


NOTES/DEDUCTIONS:
-	Exposure (# of locations) for top brands = revenue, sales.
-	McDonald’s split brand, quietly among the highest earners.
-	Dehli, Bangalore, etc. Large cities are split into provinces and each of these cities once properly summed are the most profitable.
-	Reviews as currently constructed are wildly uneven. Little can be gleaned from them beyond a vague sense of popularity/performance.
-	Cuisine is possibly the Key factor across every metric.

Solutions:
-	Stick to major cities. Establish a presence in Mumbai. 
-	Work with large chains whenever possible. 
-	If working with a smaller brand, stick to one of the top-performing cuisines (Indian/Chinese/Fast Food/Bakery/Beverage)
-	Maximize profit by encouraging major brands to offer alternative cuisine options.
BONUS:
-	Much of this data is hidden behind error, be thorough. 
-	Ratings have limited use but can be improved. Encourage customers to leave honest reviews on affiliated brands to vet performance. (Aim should be for a 3.8 or above)
