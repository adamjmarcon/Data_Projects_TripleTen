Introduction:
-In this project we will determine the cause for the unusually high rate of return at the Superstore and how best to curtail this negative trend.

Hypothesis:
-There are likely a few key factors contributing to the unusual rate of return at the superstore. 
In this study we will approach the data from Location (region/State), Product, Customer and Time of Year to determine which of these metrics best explains the rate of return and how to lower it in the future.

Visuals:
-The findings of this analysis will be displayed in a final dashboard comprised of three slides, and presented in a comprehensive breakdown via a 5 to 10 minute Loom video.

Deductions:
- The customer metric is a misnomer. While there are "problem customers" who tend to return at higher rates than others, this isn't substantial enough to be a key metric.
- Time of Year revealed an expected increase in returns during the holiday season, but not a notable increase in Rate of Return.
- Location is our primary metric. While there are products that struggle, in particular Office Supplies, this is significantly increased in the Western Region.
- By going a step deeper we learned that the major contributor to the increased Rate of Return is the absurd Sum of Returns in California. Thye overperform in Rate of Retrun and are the far and away highest Sum of Returns.

Solutions:
- Discourage returns in California (or Western Region).
- Perhaps a no refund policy on Office Supplies in California and ensure accurate item descriptions to prevent confusion from customers.
