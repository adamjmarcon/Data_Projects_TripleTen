My presentation is 10 minutes long. I hope that is okay. Frankly, I wanted to dive deeper into the analysis than a 3-5 minute presentation would allow. My final dashboards also do not match my mockups. I ultimately decided to split them into 3 slides to make the material easier to follow and to properly follow my narrative. I trust this is okay. Everything else should be as expected, if not please let me know what I can do to improve. The link to my presentation will be posted below. Thank you!
